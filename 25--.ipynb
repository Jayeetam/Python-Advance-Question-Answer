    "A numpy array is an nD (n=1,2,3,....) set or sequence of values arranged like a list or matrix. DataFrame is an analog of a two-dimensional array with both flexible row indices and flexible column names in a tabular structure format."

    "### Q4. Why is it essential to print a legend on a stock market chart?\n",
    "The stock market chart is a way of distinguishing the novice from the an expert investor.

    "Start and end parameters are best to use for that purpose. They denote the start and end date work, as the name suggests. Within that timeframe, we can restrict the duration. Moreover parameters like period and frequency can also be used to know the frequency of duration.\n",

    "### Q6. What is the definition of a 180-day moving average?\n",
    "180-day moving average gives the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over the 180 days in the past.The moving average gives investors and traders a sense of the incoming trend of the stock and potential resistance.\n",
